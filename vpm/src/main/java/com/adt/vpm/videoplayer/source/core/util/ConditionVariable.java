 * An interruptible condition variable. This class provides a number of benefits over {@link

 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Consistent use of ({@link Clock#elapsedRealtime()} for timing {@link #block(long)} timeout
 *       intervals. {@link android.os.ConditionVariable} used {@link System#currentTimeMillis()}
 *       prior to Android 10, which is not a correct clock to use for interval timing because it's
 *       not guaranteed to be monotonic.
 *   <li>Support for injecting a custom {@link Clock}.
 *   <li>The ability to query the variable's current state, by calling {@link #isOpen()}.
 *   <li>{@link #open()} and {@link #close()} return whether they changed the variable's state.
 * </ul>
